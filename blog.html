              <p class="card-text">
                Author : <small class="text-muted">Isaac Ssemugenyi</small>
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                In everyone's day to day life, we are presented with different
                challenges of life, however small or big the challenges of life
                may be, this makes us take different actions based on our own
                life setup. We at times find that we can treasure what we
                consider more important in our life, we can also consider what
                gives us the immediate pleasure or what gives us a quick success
                in life, also at time we prioritize what we can finish the
                fastest. However, these decisions that we make on a daily basis
                end up defining our whole life and we end up living by them.
                These in the end impact us as people either positively or
                negatively making us more successful and fulfilled or less
                successful and not fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                This brings us to the Time Matrix, which defines how one
                specifically a programmer decides on how to spend their time,
                remember time waits for no one, the way one decides to spend
                their time becomes a key fact in how one's life will turn out to
                be in a lifetime.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                The Time Matrix talks about the 4 quadrants, where the first
                quadrant (Q1) specifies the "Important and Urgent" challenges
                and the second quadrant (Q2) specifies the "Important but Not
                Urgent" challenges, the third quadrant (Q1) specifies the "Not
                Important but Urgent" challenges and lastly the fourth quadrant
                (Q1) specifying "Not Important and Not Urgent" challenges. The
                four quadrants represent what we do on a daily basis and it
                entirely reflects how we make day to day decisions on doing
                this.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                By choosing a few examples to reflect on, in the first quadrant
                is where we like to do tasks at the rush hours when the
                deadlines are yet to be due, attend to urgent meetings and
                before we realize eventually we are totally worn out and can no
                longer be productive and effective, in the second quadrant is
                where we have a task that is important but not so urgent and has
                human beings and developers tend to ignore this quadrant for
                good yet it is within this quadrant that people develop a habit
                of daily practice that makes them more effective and move people
                mountains. In quadrant three lies our distractions, we consider
                these urgent but forget that they are not important at all,
                these carry along with the irrelevant meetings (unplanned) that
                take more time than they would take, attending to people's minor
                issues and unimportant emails, phone calls, commenting on posts
                on Facebook excessively and watching other people's status in
                times you would be doing something productive, in quadrant three
                and four we consume more time than we can possibly think as they
                are more relaxing and addictive in nature.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Fight the temptation of submitting to Q1 and Q3, do away with Q4
                and concentrate on Q2, this is the source of success and role
                modeling. The quadrant of fulfillment and achievement of the
                personal mission statement.

              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Software development as a career path is filled with hopes of
                becoming the guy to build the next multi-million dollar
                application for every newbie in the software field. Often times
                new aspiring developers jump in with a lot of hopes just to
                achieve this, dive in the learning day in, day out. During the
                course of learning, developers then get sucked up by the already
                existing experienced developers with too much work experience, a
                lot of projects worked on and built. This starts to pose threats
                to the new developers and they start to doubt their potential,
                skills, and capability of what they can contribute to society.
                During the process of self-doubt, the introvert mind
                (personality) set in, this slowly by slowly consumes the
                aspiring developers from the inside, and what makes this a big
                threat is that these developers can't possibly get to know how
                good they are or have become.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                This mindset hinders them from expressing themselves in the
                anyway as developers but rather just sit down alongside
                experienced geeks and listen on how they brag and explain their
                experience with the different technologies they've worked with.
                Just to break out a little bit.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Let's review the human body, a human body on its own is a system
                with a couple of individual components put together to perform
                specific tasks and in the end, form a human system. However,
                when we look closely at the human system (body) few of these
                components are visible to the naked human eye.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                What we could term as the most important parts of the human
                system are actually hidden inside the human body. Back to the
                introvert point, a lot of developers have or are better on
                specific technologies and are at some extent even better than
                some of the developers they think are more experienced than them
                but they don't expose themselves to the potential chances where
                they can actually be identified and given a chance to do
                something good in the software sector, these developers end up
                leaving in the corners of their apartments, live miserable lives
                and quitting programming as a career.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Unless given an aid like an x-ray machine, ultra-sound, its when
                you can get to see some of these other components (organs) of
                the human body that perform in sync to learn the human system.
                So in the same context of software development, it would require
                a patient talent seeker or a friend to look deep inside an
                introvert developer to find out that he/she is actually a
                capable candidate for a particular software development task.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Who on earth would have this time to try and search into an
                introverted developer to find out how much you can do or add to
                a team?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                I argue you to go out there, build a presentable profile from
                the many projects you have on Github, build a personal profile
                websites, attend community Developer groups, be present on
                social platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter to mention
                but a few, write about your experience on platforms like medium.
                Build a personal brand and let the world know you exist.
              </p>
