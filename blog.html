              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                When I rode across mainland China, I was amazed at how easy it was. All I needed was a smartphone. But as useful as my phone was for navigation, it tethered me to our high-tech, ultra-convenient modern world. For my next tour, I’ve decided to ditch technology altogether. 

                Over 4,000 kilometres this summer, I was never at a loss for directions. A multitude of apps for everything from altitude to road quality to accommodation options meant that my riding was interrupted by very few real surprises.
                
                “But that’s a good thing!” I can practically hear my Dad, an enthusiastic gadget freak, saying. Think of all the frustrations you’ve avoided! All the time you’ve saved! The technology was painstakingly developed for exactly this purpose!
                
                He’s right, of course. I did save time and plenty of effort with powerful tech at my fingertips. But as the weeks rolled by, I started noticing several caveats to all this saved time.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                First, I spent more of my day looking at a screen than I would have liked. I was out in nature but the details of my route were, perversely, distracting me from the natural world. Second, with my phone in hand, I couldn’t help but stay connected to the urban world I was trying to leave behind. I saw the same email, Whatsapp, and missed call notifications as always, and I had video contact with my anxious parents almost every day. I felt armed to the teeth with tech — checking maps, tracking my distance and speed, and taking photos and videos to upload in real time to various social media accounts, feeding the hungry followers who told me they loved keeping track of my travels.
                I never looked at road signs or stopped to ask directions. I didn’t need to. After a while, I realized that such detailed route planning had almost removed the element of wayfinding that makes long distance bike trips so enjoyable. I had gained time but had I lost quality?

                Ditching the phone would be a completely different experience. I would be forced to interact with my environment, to talk to locals if (when) I got lost, and to really pay attention to my surroundings.

                The idea filled me with just enough terror for me to think that it might be a good one. 
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                <strong>But what if you get lost?</strong><br>
                This is the first concern that comes to mind. If I don’t have a GPS app on my phone following my planned route at every turn, it might take longer to get where I need to go, working under the assumption that I'll take a wrong turn or have to study the map to find my way.

                But as long as I'm prepared, getting lost on a road bike tour doesn't have to be scary. I'll allow myself extra time and supplies and be flexible with my destination. I won't plan to go off-road into remote, uninhabited areas, but I'll still be able to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy the cycling. A compass, a good map, and a decent grasp of the local language might just be enough.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                <strong>What if something bad happened?</strong><br>

                Now this is more of an issue.<br>

                Cycling carries risks. What if my bike breaks down in the middle of nowhere or I get sick? I'll need to be able to contact someone in such an emergency. The story of Chris McCandless in Into the Wild is enough to warn anyone of how horrifically easy it is to get into trouble when truly isolated. For a long tour, the argument for a phone is stronger because the likelihood of something going awry is greater. For a shorter tour, however, that likelihood is lower. <br>

                While the stereotyped dangers people read about in the news — attack or murder — are scary, even more so for marginalized people, traffic is by far my biggest danger when I cycle, a risk which is minimized as much as possible by exercising caution and avoiding high-traffic, high-speed roads. <br>

                If I break down or am injured, realistically what I'll need at the moment is someone to give me a lift or call for help. In choosing a less remote route, I know someone will come by eventually, and they’ll likely have a phone or an empty seat. For extra safety and fun, I'm considering riding with a friend who is up for the challenge.

                            <strong>Road Test: Specialized Turbo Como 3.0</strong
                >
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Author : <small class="text-muted">Dan Meyer</small>
              </p>
            
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Among Specialized’s electrified offerings, all of which are named Turbo something — Levo, Kenevo, Creo, Vado, and Como — the Turbo Como is the “comfort” model, a bike designed for ambling around town. It’s styled like a cruiser bike, and indeed it rides a bit like a beach cruiser: seated over the rear wheel, the front way out ahead of you, relaxed, unhurried. But even if you’re going nowhere in no hurry, there’s a 250W motor helping you get there faster. The Turbo Como is a Class 1 eBike, meaning it’s pedal-assist only (no throttle) with a maximum assisted speed of 20 MPH. The 3.0 model tested here comes with a 460Wh battery integrated into the downtube. The 4.0 and 5.0 models — there are also “Low-Entry” (step-through) models at each price point as well — offer similar motors with larger batteries.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                The Como’s aluminum frame and fork have rack and fender mounts to suit your all-weather and carrying needs, the meaty tires help tune out bad road vibrations, and it even includes a kickstand and front and rear lights. The drivetrain is simple, dependable Shimano Alivio; with nine gears, it’s plenty to get you up even the steepest of hills. And braking power comes from Tektro’s T275 hydros, which are a smart, affordable spec for this application. In the cockpit you’ll find a comfortable, swept-back handlebar adorned with a bell and a remote for dialing up or down the boost level, as well as a display that shows your speed, battery level, mileage, etc. I found the bell particularly handy; on the Como, you will be going faster than pedestrians, drivers, or even you would expect, so it’s important to make your presence known.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Aft of the cockpit is — surprise! — a saddle, and a big, squishy one at that. I generally don’t find comfort saddles like these to be terribly, well, comfortable, but it suits the Como given the pedaling position. The seat tube angle is a very slack 68°, putting a lot of your weight on your behind and necessitating a wider perch.

                This being a comfort eBike, smooth is the name of the game. Regardless of which of the three modes you’re in — Eco, Sport, or Turbo — the assist comes on smoothly and without any undue violence. Unlike some other eBikes that shove so hard you nearly fall off the back, the Como is more civilized.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Whereas other mid-drive eBikes suffer from resistance when you cross the assistance threshold, Specialized’s motors — which it developed with Brose, the German electric motor manufacturer — eschew direct drive for belt-driven planetary gears. According to Marco Sonderegger, leader of Turbo eBike Product Development at Specialized, the belt drive makes for a quieter motor and eliminates that resistance. Indeed, although I rarely bothered to go any faster than 20 MPH, doing so was a much smoother affair than I’ve experienced on other eBikes.

                The real genius of an eBike is not that you’re getting someplace faster or perspiring less along the way. Instead, it’s this: as soon as I picked up the Como from Bingham Cyclery, my local Specialized dealer here in Salt Lake City, I found myself making up excuses to run to the grocery store or to the post office. Trips for which I might have otherwise walked or taken the car or simply not taken at all, I was now riding the Como.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                To test its carrying capacity, I mounted a rear rack, affixed a couple of large Ortlieb panniers, and scurried off to the grocery store. This store happens to be at the top of a large hill, and, as expected, getting there on the Como was a breeze. Once there, I bought a week’s worth of groceries and crammed it all in the panniers. It was enough that, coupled with the Como’s already hefty 47.6 pounds, I could hardly lift up the back of the bike to swing it around. Once rolling, the Como handled pretty well in spite of all that weight in the back. And going down the hill was a good test of the Tektro brakes, one they passed with flying colors.

                When it comes to range, the Turbo Como likely won’t be your pick for an electrified cross-country epic. Specialized doesn’t offer a claimed range for the 3.0, but it does have a handy range calculator on its website. Using Eco mode with few stops and on flat terrain — and an average speed of 16 MPH — the calculator claims a maximum range of 53 miles for me, which sounds about right. In Turbo mode, that drops to 29 miles.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Indeed, I made the 20-mile round-trip trek to REI a couple of times on the Como, a mostly flat route with a lot of stops. I used Turbo mode because, well, why not, and, having started with a full charge, each time I returned with about a quarter to a third of the battery left. Once depleted, it’s about four to six hours to reach full charge. I usually plugged it in at night when it got low and enjoyed a full battery the next morning. (The battery is removable and lockable.) 

                Another handy tool is Specialized’s Mission Control app, which connects to the bike via Bluetooth. In addition to tracking your rides and showing your bike’s firmware status, the app lets you customize the assist modes to your liking. But the most useful part of the app is Smart Control. With Smart Control, you pick how far you want to ride by time or distance, along with how much climbing your route has and how much assist you want on the climbs, and the app will adjust the motor to get you to your destination without depleting the battery. It’s a great way to eliminate range anxiety.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                At $3,250, the Como 3.0 is Specialized’s most affordable eBike. There are certainly less expensive eBikes out there (such as the Charge XC in last month’s issue), but it’s hard to discount the benefits of buying from a major brand with widespread dealer support. If it were my money — and, with each new eBike I ride, it looks increasingly more likely that it will be my money someday soon — I’d spring for the Como 5.0 for its larger (600 Wh) battery, fenders, and front Pizza Rack. But the 3.0 is an excellent foray into electrified ownership, a bike that can serve your cruising and commuting needs and even carry your camping gear for a quick overnight, assuming you keep your mileage in check.

                Author’s note: While I had the Como in for testing, it kept disappearing from my apartment. Where was it going? Turns out my wife had been stealing it for her commutes up the (very) steep hill to the University of Utah. In her own words:
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                “When Dan wheeled the Como through our front door, I knew it would be my new commuting bike. It was striking just how easy it made my mornings. Thanks to Turbo mode, my commute time was cut in half. I no longer had to plan two outfits: one for class and one for the ride up to class. I could now just toss on my scrubs, throw a lunch into my pack, and be on my way. The integrated headlight and taillight meant never needing to worry about whether I had charged my usual commuting lights. The zippy pace erased my fears about creeping slowly uphill in the dark with impatient motorists honking at me from behind.”

                So maybe the real danger of buying an eBike isn’t running out of juice or developing a hernia from heaving it up a set of stairs. Instead, the real danger is that you might have to buy two.
